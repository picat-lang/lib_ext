# lib_ext
This repository contains library predicates and functions intended for inclusion in the existing 'util' module and the newly created 'algo' module. The original motivation was to incorporate Picat libraries developed by individual Advent of Code participants into Picat’s built-in library. f you have libraries of general interest and are willing to share them with the community, you are warmly invited to contribute. All contributed code will undergo a rigorous review and may be edited before being incorporated into the standard library.
