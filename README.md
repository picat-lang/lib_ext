# lib_ext
This repository contains library predicates and functions intended for inclusion in the existing 'util' module and the newly created 'algo' module. The original motivation was to incorporate Picat libraries developed by individual Advent of Code participants into Picat’s built-in library. If you have libraries of general interest, you are warmly invited to contribute.
